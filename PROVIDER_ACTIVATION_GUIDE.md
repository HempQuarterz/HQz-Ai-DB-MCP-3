## 🎯 Image Provider Activation Guide

### Current Situation
- ✅ **Placeholder provider**: Active and working (FREE)
- ❌ **Other providers**: Need API keys in Supabase Edge Functions

### 🚀 My Recommendation: Complete with Placeholder First!

You're already 54% done (81/149 images). Just finish with placeholder:

```bash
python run_generation.py
# Option 3 → Batch size: 59 (to process all pending)
# Then Option 2 → Queue remaining products
# Then Option 3 → Process those too
```

**Why this is smart:**
1. Get 100% image coverage NOW (free!)
2. See how the system works
3. Upgrade to real AI later when ready

### 🔐 If You Really Want Real AI Providers

The issue is that API keys need to be in Supabase Edge Function environment, not just your local .env.

**Easy Workaround - Use OpenAI (since you have the key):**

1. Install Supabase CLI:
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

2. Login and link:
```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref ktoqznqmlnxrtvubewyz
```

3. Add your existing OpenAI key:
```bash
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=%OPENAI_API_KEY%
```

4. Then in the app, activate dall_e_3

**But honestly**, finish with placeholder first! You can always regenerate with real AI later.

### 📊 Cost Comparison
- **Placeholder (now)**: $0.00 for all 149
- **Stable Diffusion**: $0.30 for all 149  
- **DALL-E 3**: $5.96 for all 149

### 🎨 What Placeholder Images Look Like
- Professional colored rectangles
- Color based on plant part:
  - 🟫 Seed products (brown)
  - 🟢 Fiber products (green)
  - 🟣 Flower products (purple)
  - 🟤 Hurd products (tan)
  - 🟢 Leaf products (light green)
- Product name as text overlay
- 1024x1024 resolution

These are perfect for:
- Testing your app
- Placeholder while developing
- Quick visual identification

### ✅ Bottom Line
Keep going with placeholder! You're doing great. Get to 100% coverage first, then consider upgrading.
