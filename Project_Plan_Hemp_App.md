# Unified Development Plan: The Comprehensive Industrial Hemp Web/Mobile Application (Supabase Focused)

## I. Core Objective & Vision:

To develop a visually engaging, highly interactive, and easily navigable web and mobile application that serves as the definitive, comprehensive global resource for all aspects of industrial hemp. The application will empower a diverse audience—including researchers, businesses, farmers, consumers, and policymakers—by providing meticulously categorized information on every current and potential use, product, cultivation focus, processing method, market dynamic, regulatory landscape, and scientific advancement related to industrial hemp.

## II. Information Architecture & Core Categorization Strategy:

The app's navigation and data organization will be built around a hierarchical and interconnected model:

*   **Primary Navigation - Hemp Plant Archetypes:**
    *   Users will initially select from distinct hemp plant archetypes based on primary cultivation focus (e.g., "Fiber & Stalk Dominant," "Seed & Grain Dominant," "Floral & Cannabinoid Dominant"). This aligns with the different cultivation practices and primary outputs detailed in your documents.
    *   Each archetype will have a dedicated page with visuals and general characteristics.
*   **Secondary Navigation - Plant Parts:**
    *   Within each archetype, users will navigate to specific usable plant parts (e.g., Stalk - Bast Fiber, Stalk - Hurd/Shiv, Whole Hemp Seeds, Hemp Seed Oil, Hemp Flour, Hemp Protein, Hemp Seed Meal/Cake, Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Hemp Biomass, Dried Leaves/Flowers, Hemp Roots).
    *   This level will lead to listings of uses/products derived from that part.
*   **Tertiary Categorization - Industry & Application Area:**
    *   Uses and products will be further categorized by the primary industry they serve (e.g., Textiles & Fashion, Construction & Building Materials, Food & Beverages, Pharmaceuticals & Nutraceuticals, Automotive, Paper, Energy, Cosmetics & Personal Care, Environmental & Agricultural Applications, Animal Nutrition & Care, Bioplastics & Composites, Advanced Materials).
    *   Sub-categories within industries (e.g., Textiles -> Apparel, Home Furnishings; Construction -> Hempcrete, Insulation) will provide granular detail.
*   **Advanced Visualization - Branches & Nodes (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Consider incorporating the "Branches & Nodes" concept (from "Listed Hemp Usage") as an alternative, visually interconnected navigation path in a later phase, showing the flow from plant part to multiple end-uses.

## III. Key App Features & Integrated Content Modules (Supabase Focused):

The application will be a modular platform, with the "Comprehensive Product & Application Catalog" at its core, enriched by interconnected satellite modules.

## V. App Functionality (Enhanced & Supabase-Centric):

*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:**
    *   Global keyword search leveraging PostgreSQL's full-text search on `search_vector` columns (in `uses_products`, `companies`, `research_entries`, etc.).
    *   Multi-faceted filtering on listing pages (plant part, industry, sub-category, commercialization stage, region).
*   **Interactive Data Visualization:** Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for market trends, regional data comparisons, etc.
*   **User Accounts & Personalization (Supabase Auth):**
    *   Save searches, bookmark favorite entries (uses, companies, research).
    *   Subscribe to alerts (new products in a category, regulatory changes for a region).
*   **Content Submission/Suggestion Portal:** Moderated system for community contributions, enhancing data richness.
*   **Glossary of Terms:** Comprehensive, searchable glossary.
*   **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first, ensuring excellent UX on all devices.
*   **Admin Panel/CMS:** A secure interface (custom-built or using tools like Appsmith/Retool connected to Supabase) for CRUD operations on all database tables, managing user submissions, and content curation.

## VI. Numbering and Estimation:

*   The `id` (BIGINT) field in `uses_products` will be the unique numerical identifier.
*   Dynamic Total Count: Fetch count from `uses_products` via Supabase client.

## VII. Technological Stack (Supabase Focused):

*   **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions).
    *   Consider leveraging PostgreSQL's graph capabilities (e.g., Recursive CTEs, Apache AGE extension when mature in Supabase) for advanced relationship analysis and features like 'Branches & Nodes' visualization.
*   **Frontend:** Next.js (recommended for SEO, SSR/SSG), SvelteKit, or similar modern JavaScript framework.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or a preferred CSS framework/methodology.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify for frontend; Supabase for backend services.
*   **Image Handling:** Supabase Storage with appropriate RLS policies. Consider image optimization techniques.
*   **Search (Advanced):** PostgreSQL Full-Text Search. For very large scale, consider dedicated search services like Algolia or Meilisearch in a later phase, which can be synced with Supabase data.

## VIII. Data Acquisition, Curation, and Maintenance Strategy:

*   **Initial Data Population:** Systematically extract data from all provided documents (Listed Hemp Usage for the ~315 core uses, Global Industrial Hemp Company Directory for companies, Industrial Hemp Uses Comprehensive Report and Hemp's Versatile Industrial Applications for detailed descriptions, benefits, processing, history, etc., Start research for market/regulatory context).
*   **Ongoing Acquisition:**
    *   Dedicated research team to monitor academic journals, industry reports, patent databases, regulatory updates, company news.
    *   Ethical web scraping and news aggregation (with AI assistance for summarization/categorization).
