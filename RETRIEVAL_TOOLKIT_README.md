# 📚 HempQuarterz Agent Retrieval Toolkit

I've created a comprehensive toolkit to help you retrieve and set up the missing agent code from your previous chats. Here's what's available:

## 🛠️ Tools Created

### 1. **CODE_RETRIEVAL_PLAN.md** 📋
**Purpose:** Detailed step-by-step guide for finding each missing file
- Specific search terms for each agent
- Expected file structure and content
- Common code patterns to look for
- Troubleshooting tips

### 2. **RETRIEVAL_CHECKLIST.md** ✅
**Purpose:** Quick checklist to track your progress
- Priority order (BaseAgent first!)
- Quick search patterns you can copy/paste
- File size expectations
- Progress tracker

### 3. **verify_agents.py** 🔍
**Purpose:** Verification script to check if everything is properly installed
```bash
python verify_agents.py
```
- Checks all file existence
- Verifies file sizes
- Tests all imports
- Shows what's missing

### 4. **generate_templates.py** 🔧
**Purpose:** Creates template files if you can't find the original code
```bash
python generate_templates.py
```
- Generates basic structure for missing agents
- Includes proper imports and class structure
- NOT full implementations - just starting points

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Check Current Status
```bash
python verify_agents.py
```
This will show you exactly what's missing.

### Step 2: Search for Missing Code
1. Open `CODE_RETRIEVAL_PLAN.md`
2. For each missing file:
   - Use the provided search terms
   - Look in your Claude chat history
   - Check the expected structure

### Step 3: Track Your Progress
Use `RETRIEVAL_CHECKLIST.md` to mark off completed files

### Step 4: Verify After Each File
After pasting each file, run:
```bash
python verify_agents.py
```

### Step 5: If You Can't Find Something
As a last resort, use:
```bash
python generate_templates.py
```
This creates basic templates you can build upon.

## 🔍 Search Strategy

### Most Effective Search Terms:
1. **For BaseAgent**: `"@rate_limited"` or `"class BaseAgent"`
2. **For Orchestrator**: `"LangGraph"` or `"dispatch_task"`
3. **For other agents**: `"class [AgentName]Agent"`

### Where to Look:
- Chat sessions about "HempQuarterz AI agents"
- Sessions mentioning "autonomous agents"
- Code blocks that are 200+ lines long
- Sessions from the same timeframe as the Compliance Agent

## 📁 What You Already Have

✅ **Fully Functional:**
- Compliance Agent (all 4 files)
- Configuration file
- Database migration
- Example usage script

❌ **Still Needed:**
- BaseAgent class (CRITICAL - do this first!)
- AI utilities
- 6 other agent implementations

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Start with BaseAgent** - Everything depends on it
2. **Check file sizes** - Agent files should be 200-400 lines
3. **Test imports frequently** - Use verify_agents.py
4. **Look for long code blocks** - Agents are substantial implementations

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

1. Run `verify_agents.py` to see what's missing
2. Check `CODE_RETRIEVAL_PLAN.md` for detailed search guidance
3. Use `generate_templates.py` to create placeholders
4. The Compliance Agent is already working - you can study its structure

## 📊 Expected Result

Once all files are in place:
- All 8 agents will be functional
- The orchestrator can coordinate workflows
- Daily automation will run smoothly
- Full hemp business automation!

Good luck with the retrieval process! The tools are designed to make it as straightforward as possible. 🌿
